# Project Title

This project is to address the issue of phising attempets as well as inform you of any malware is contained within the scanned linked. If you feel a website or a link you come across is shadey, copy and paste it into the entry feild and submit.

# How does it work?
- The API from VirusTotal allows us to send a request into their servers and gather infromation about the link you inserted. Whatever data they have documented will show, however for the user we simplfied the data into 4 types. Harmless, Malicious, Suspicious, and Undetected. This does not directly tell you what the website holds but it will give you a general idea of what can be contained inside. For example if there's a count for suspicious, you can assume you can come across something that doesn't look right based off the data you saw before clicking on the link.

This project is using the free version of the VirusTotal API so it doesn't have advance features. Just the basics, so please use the links at your own discretion as this project does not allow us to stop anything only to infom you, the user.
